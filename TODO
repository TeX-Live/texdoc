For next release
================

alias fixme = latex/fixme/fixme doesn't work (see Dan's report 2011-10-08)

aliases for *cite.sty? see cite/README

fix FIXME in texdoc.cnf (alias cjk.txt not working, maybe a case issue)

Scoring overhaul
----------------

Good package (either from the tlpdb or directory name) should be much more
important for scoring. Eg, spie/article.pdf should never get such a high score
for article.

With "texdoc todo",
        todo/todo-spl.pdf
should win over
        todonotes/todonotes.pdf                Package documentation

With "texdoc ean"
        ean/Readme
should win over
        barcodes/eandoc = Package doc
(probably)

Files found using the tlpdb only should be scored heuristicly as if <pkgname>
were asked for. (Make sure heurisitc scoring returns a higher score for
names actually containing the string. Check the result with psnfss2e aliases.)

see aliases marked XXX in texdoc.cnf

For later
=========

Internal
--------

Use texlive/tlpdb.tlu for tlpdb reading.

Get ready for Lua 5.2?

Misc
----

Use alt-getopt for options parsing (needs to be patched for error handling and
optional arguments: write my own gnu_getopt_long?) (Reinhard working on
something, too.)

Make the list of bad comments from the catalogue configurable? (Currently,
readme hardcoded.)

--html-lists options: output the lists as html (à la mthelp)

--index-by-topic: build on the fly a local version of the catalogue's
bytopic.html page (see also --apropos)

Searching by macro name???
    - http://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2010-May/025832.html
    - other ideas?

Make list of "better" comments from the catalogue, for example
"documentation" might get a bonus.

Try to guess which .tex files are examples and allow them?


Not sure about that
-------------------

Information from the tlpdb isn't always as up-to-date as the catalogue, in case
the catalogue has been fixed for a package that wasn't update. Should I generate
Data.meta.lua directly from a fresh catalogue version?
    For now, just force update of the packages in TL when I notice.

Try guessin lang from file name when there is no info in the catalogue?

What to do with tools/coverage? May want to discuss this with Phlipp S.

tlpdb cache should check if ext_list has changed, in theory.
    Is it worth it in practice? I'll do it if someone complains...

BUG: finds non-existing files in tl2010 (probably from another tlpdb?)
ex: texdoc luasseq on my machine while tl10 is active
    Ok, got it: tlpdb cache is not invalidated when switching to an older
    tlpdb files from the same release. I wonder if it's worth fixing.

Caching: now used only for tlpdb. Is it worth using it for ls-R files?
Configuration files?

Add support for shell-style globs (standard regex is probably too hard)
    Well, would anyone really use it? (would be for patterns in texdoc.cnf, not
    for texdoc arguments)

Use the 2-links trick from kpse when exploring trees? Check how it works on
windows.


Using the catalogue
-------------------

Obsolescence information could be useful (Phil's suggestion), but may be hard to
obtain (not in the tlpdb)... Well, if it's in the catalogue, I can ship a
Data.obsolete.lua file with the information...

Do something with the description from the catalogue?

Help maintainers standardise comments in order to allow for more accurate
scoring/classification?

--apropos using Jim's keywords and categorization, see Karl's mail:
http://tug.org/pipermail/texdoc/2010q3/000213.html


Auto-generation of doc files ???
--------------------------------

To allow installing TL without the doc trees (cuts off the size by 2).
Suggested by Will.


Port on MikTeX ???
------------------

Lots of TeX-live specific stuff (implicitly) embedded in various places...

Add a function in texlua's kpse library returning all files for which a certain
Lua function (given as argument) returns true. Use only it.

What to do with all the functions using tlpdb? Is it possible to use an
equivalent on MikTeX?

Adapt to the different tree layout in MikTeX (TEXMFHOME etc don't exist).

How to detect the distro? What to do with aliases?


Notes and references
--------------------

Texdoc GUI project going on since early May 2010, see messages from Enrico
Gregorio in my (mpg) inbox.

Used by vim script #2945 (AutomaticTexPlugin) as F1 and :TexDoc.
