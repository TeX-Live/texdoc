Version 0.85
------------
Compatibility with LuaTeX 0.74+ (Lua 5.2).

Version 0.84 (TeX Live 2012)
============================
Fix -f output when TEXMFHOME contains a list of paths. Bug sort-of reported
by Matthew Leingang, see http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/42920/

Version 0.83
------------
Minor adjustments in the scoring system.

Version 0.82
------------
Fixes to the default viewer/destkop environment detection:
- try gvfs-open with Gnome
- always try xdg-open first (usually more up-to-date)
Thanks to Axel E. Retif for informing me that newer versions of Ubuntu don't
ship gnome-open by default any more.

Version 0.81 (TeX Live 2011)
============================
Allow configuration files to be found in all TEXMF trees.
The default one should now be installed in TEXMFDIST (in upstream TeX Live) or
in a tree search after TEXMFLOCAL (in downstream distros).

Delay default viewer detection, see:
http://tug.org/pipermail/tex-live/2011-May/029150.html

Drop long-deprecated things:
- --search (-> --showall), --verbosity-level and old syntax of -v
- alias_switch, -a, -A, --alias, --noalias
- 'regex' mode,

Various internal cleanups and rearrangements.

Version 0.80
============
New 'lang' configuration option (defaults on system locale): now <name>-de.pdf
wins over <name>.pdf if German is preferred. Patch kindly provided by Philipp
Stephani. Also works with aliases (eg koma-de = scrguide wins over koma =
scrguien).

Document the previously undocumented options from 0.72-tl2010.

Accept htm as a valid extension, synonym for html. Emit less warnings about
viewers.

Version 0.72 as in TeX Live 2010
--------------------------------
New (undocumented) settings (bad)basenme_list, parallel to (bad)ext_list.

New (undocumented) setting item suffix_list for known documentation suffixes,
previously hardcoded.

New (undocumented) option --just-view for use by front-end programs.

Version 0.72
------------
Fix stupid bug introduced in 0.70: texdoc would crash if called without
arguments. (Reported by Maxime Chupin.)

Version 0.71
------------
Fix bug introduced in 0.70: some results were duplicated on windows. (Reported
by Uwe Siart.)

Version 0.70
============
Use information from the TeX Live package database (some of it coming from the
CTAN catalogue) to improve search results. Display some of this information.

Show the current settings in --help message.

Misc. internal changes & fixes.

Deprecate -a, --alias, -A, --noalias and alias_switch.

Version 0.66
------------
Turn the -v=N, --verbosity=N command-line option into a pair of related options
-v, --verbose and -q, --quiet (more standard, Karl's suggestion). Also remove
uselessly verbose debug items so --debug is usable again.

Rework help text (Karl's suggestion).

Issue a warning about DISPLAY not being set on generic Unix before trying to
start a viewer.

Small internal clean-ups.

Version 0.65
------------
Make it easier to change the list of configuration files used (eg for
downstream distributions).

Version 0.64
------------
Fix a crash when DISPLAY is unset on Unix by querying xprop more carefully.
(Bug introduced in 0.61.)

Version 0.63
------------
Fix a bug on windows which prevented from viewing sty files.

Version 0.62
------------
Support for zipped documentation is now an official option.
Please read the warnings before using it!

Version 0.61
------------
Detect desktop environments (KDE4, KDE, GNOME, XFCE) for viewer selection.

Version 0.60
============
Changed the search/alias/score logic. See section 2 of the manual for details,
but here is a primer:
- alias now /adds/ patterns to be search, it is no more a substitution
- new scoring system, partially configurable, with improved heuristics

The beginning of the manual has been completely rewritten.

Bugs have been fixed as usual, and probably some others introduced...

Version 0.50
============
- New option for machine-readable output.
- Bugfixes (esp. for zipped file support (Unix only)).
- Hopefully more sensible default viewer selection.

Version 0.49
------------
Major code rewrite. No big user-visible change, except a few bugs fixed and new
debugging levels.

Version 0.47 (TeX Live 2009)
----------------------------
Adapt for man pages named *.man1.pdf instead of *.pdf.
(Temporary hack, done better since version 0.60.)

Warning: zip support probably broken!

Version 0.46
------------
Avoid using lfs.currentdir() and lfs.chdir() which are broken on Solaris 10 
in LuaTeX 0.40

Version 0.45
------------
Fix possible line ending problems on windows with certain versions of LuaTeX

Version 0.44
------------
- fixing viewer problems on Windows
- expanding the list of default viewers on generic Unix


Version 0.43
------------
Improve support for zipped documentation and comments about it in the default
configuration file. (Thank Norbert Preining for his help.)

Various fixes, aliases updates as usual.

Version 0.42
------------
Improvements to default txt viewer on Windows (thanks to Phil Taylor).

New debugging levels; new names for debugging options.

New configuration file allowing to run the development version more easily.

Changes to the way files are displayed. Results are numbered even when -I is
used.

Documentation update.  Alias additions and fixes as usual. Various bugfixes.

License switched to GPL.

Version 0.4 (TeX Live 2008)
===========================
Use our own configuration files, not texmf.cnf. Rework the way viewers are
handled, and add a few configuration options.

Add an 'alias' feature. Filter results in a more restrictive way. Add new search
modes 'mixed' and 'regex'. Turn result lists into menus.

Add a user manual in pdf.

Development passed from Frank Küster to Manuel Pégourié-Gonnard.
